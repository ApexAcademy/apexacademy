# Project Title: Apex Academy Prep
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:
Website made for Apex Academy Prep tutoring. Allows contacting through pop up email window, has animated elements, and has mobile and web compatability. Multiple files are just for images and such media but the remaining are for either the index page, which is the first page opened when you go to a websites home page, or for the contact media page which was eventually scrapped. I went through multiple iterations where contact info was on a differenet page but I ended up not going with it because it ended up not taking enough room and looked very empty and plain. I ended up putting it on the top right corner because it was just an email and on mobile version it is a phone number link instead. I have the website change through a javascript file which differentiates through screen size. If the length and width are small enough it changes the website, which is visible through the desktop version too if you make the window skinny and short. I also implimented animations on the page upon opening through javascript in the same file.
